1.Project Make It Rain
- I think the Make It Rain Project was very fun as helped me understand both Intro to JS and the use of the mouse in the code. If you pressed on your mouse, the more the rain came and I thought that to very cool to design something and rainstorm via coding with Intro to JS. To make this happen, you would need to make a draw function as well as mouse comands like if(mouseisPressed). This helped me use all knowledge on coding with the mouse in one cool project. It was awesome to get involved in the basics of animation in Intro in JS

2. Project: Fish tank
- I loved this project as it alot of shapes and code to be used to make it into one project. It was hard challenge and at first I struggled a bit with it but once I figured it out I was able to enjoy the fun out of it. You would need to use alot of shapes like ellipse functions and the coolest thing was that I was able to make the bubbles come into different sizes with a variety of draw functions. Great project and it helped to understand how to make shapes into different sizes

3. Project: Build-a-House
- I believe that this project allowed me to use my creativity as it required many unique ideas like getting grass from KhanAcedemy or to choose the texture of the walls via coding a for loop. It was very cool to build a house via coding and I taught some lessons as orginally this project was one of the hardest as I struggled to get tiles on the house and this taught me how to be patient. Also allowed me to use various Intro to JS concepts like variables and drawing functions.

4.Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe
- I believe this project was a fun way to learn about Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations as it had various visuals like aminations like the moving X's and O'S. What I loved about this is that all that hard work can be played with your friends as you built the game. It taught me about tile functions like these Tile.prototype.draw = function()

5. Project: Hoppy Beaver Extreme
- I believe like the Tic Tac Toe is was a unique way to code and the project was also very easy. It has many things that were very cool like make the background via coding. I also loved how we made it into a pacman like game 

6./7. Challenge: Box office hits database and Challenge: Book list database
- What I liked about this assignment was that it was part of the CSS of the Intro to HTML. Due to this, CSS and the asignment given to me were not known and new to me so I struggled with this challenge but I was able to finish it. Overall I liked the assignment as I liked how it made the table by itself (the computer) and how all thew movies had their ratings and etc. It also made me learn more about CSS as I was able to do other similar assignments like TO-DO List and etc

 8. Project: Shooting star
 - I think the this Project was very fun as helped me understand both Intro to JS and the use of the amination. Making/Seeing shooting stars like in movies via coding with Intro to JS. To make this happen, you would need to make a draw animation via     
    moonX = moonX - 0.5;
   This helped me use all knowledge on coding with the mouse in one cool project. It was awesome to get involved in the basics of animation in Intro in JS

9. Challenge: Mouse movement mania
- I think this assignment allowed me to play and understand the mouse in Khan Academy coding. As the challenge required us to move circle and use it as a paintbrush and seeing that was very cool and special. I liked how when I was moving the mouse to the left it looked like the circle farer and smaller and the paint felt like someone started painting far away.  

10. Challenge: Sunny snowy day
- I think this assignment allowed me to play with colour and taught me how to use it. Making a new sunny day with a snowman was pretty fun. I believe it teaches the basics the beginngers like formerly myself need
