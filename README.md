## Welcome to My Portfolio Activity


1.Project Make It Rain
- I think the Make It Rain Project was very fun as helped me understand both Intro to JS and the use of the mouse in the code. If you pressed on your mouse, the more the rain came and I thought that to very cool to design something and rainstorm via coding with Intro to JS. To make this happen, you would need to make a draw function as well as mouse comands like if(mouseisPressed). This helped me use all knowledge on coding with the mouse in one cool project. It was awesome to get involved in the basics of animation in Intro in JS

2. Project: Fish tank
- I loved this project as it alot of shapes and code to be used to make it into one project. It was hard challenge and at first I struggled a bit with it but once I figured it out I was able to enjoy the fun out of it. You would need to use alot of shapes like ellipse functions and the coolest thing was that I was able to make the bubbles come into different sizes with a variety of draw functions. Great project and it helped to understand how to make shapes into different sizes

3. Project: Build-a-House
- I believe that this project allowed me to use my creativity as it required many unique ideas like getting grass from KhanAcedemy or to choose the texture of the walls via coding a for loop. It was very cool to build a house via coding and I taught some lessons as orginally this project was one of the hardest as I struggled to get tiles on the house and this taught me how to be patient. Also allowed me to use various Intro to JS concepts like variables and drawing functions.

4.Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe
- I believe this project was a fun way to learn about Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations as it had various visuals like aminations like the moving X's and O'S. What I loved about this is that all that hard work can be played with your friends as you built the game. It taught me about tile functions like these Tile.prototype.draw = function()

5. Project: Hoppy Beaver Extreme
- I believe like the Tic Tac Toe is was a unique way to code and the project was also very easy. It has many things that were very cool like make the background via coding. I also loved how we made it into a pacman like game

6./7. Challenge: Box office hits database and Challenge: Book list database
- What I liked about this assignment was that it was part of the CSS of the Intro to HTML. Due to this, CSS and the asignment given to me were not known and new to me so I struggled with this challenge but I was able to finish it. Overall I liked the assignment as I liked how it made the table by itself (the computer) and how all thew movies had their ratings and etc. It also made me learn more about CSS as I was able to do other similar assignments like TO-DO List and etc

 8. Project: Shooting star
 - I think the this Project was very fun as helped me understand both Intro to JS and the use of the amination. Making/Seeing shooting stars like in movies via coding with Intro to JS. To make this happen, you would need to make a draw animation via     
    moonX = moonX - 0.5;
   This helped me use all knowledge on coding with the mouse in one cool project. It was awesome to get involved in the basics of animation in Intro in JS

9. Challenge: Mouse movement mania
- I think this assignment allowed me to play and understand the mouse in Khan Academy coding. As the challenge required us to move circle and use it as a paintbrush and seeing that was very cool and special. I liked how when I was moving the mouse to the left it looked like the circle farer and smaller and the paint felt like someone started painting far away.

10. Basic HTML and HTML5: Add Images to Your WebsitePassed
- I liked this assignment as it allowed me to go through the basics of HTML which was something that I forgot as I did those HTML question on Khan Academy, a long time ago. I liked how we were able to get coool photos on the screen like a cat. This similar code help me understand basics and helped to other assignments that have HTML in them

ICS4U Coding interview prompts

1. How will you continue learning about computer science?

A: Firstly, there is also a high demand for Computer Science. Canada is a country that tech jobs are booming but it lacks people to fill them. It is said that Canada needs 182,000 people to fill in certain IT positions due to shortage of tech jobs in the country.If people can fill these jobs in the economy might increase.In countries like the EU, South Korea,New Zealand and the US are trying to teach kids coding. Also the pay is pretty good for anyone also at yearly income of $78,162. This is a very high income comparing to Canadian minimum wage of $11.50 per hour and the average Canadian household in 2016 had a income yearly of $49,504. Meaning a computer engineer can be a wealthy person.

I would try to increase my knowledge of Computer Science as I am looking to be one day, a computer programmer because of its income especially since it is so high and it also sounds fun! I could help people in programs since they use the computers that were produced by computer engineers.Computer Science since Grade 9 was one of my favourite courses and after doing these different questions on different plaforms like JavaScript, Khan Academy and etc. I am also starting to like Math and Computer Science has alot of math and it is required for any computer science degree or job.


2. How does computer science/programming give you what you need to continue learning?

A: Firslty, Computer Science is a course that invities curiousity as there is various of different codes and coding languages. In computer science, things can be hard like struggling to solve a pyramix or rubik's cube or getting stuck on a question or assignment. These are things people go through on a daily basis with Computer Science. This allows the person to test their patience and work hard in every assignment to get it right. That is how CS can make you a better learner, though failure.

I would try to many questions and some of those were almost impossible to solve at first.But by being patience, I was able to slowly understand the main concepts of the course. I also procrastinated alot of my assignments so with failures, it taught to learns like not to procrastinate. I am also love CS so the more I love a course, the more I would engage with it and the more focus I am so this telling to go after the things you love in life. Overall, CS taught me how to learn more and more despite hardships and failure and not to procrastinate. As one man said “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”

3. How can art help guide you through learning about programming and computer science?

A: Many people have different ways of learning. Some are visual learners or some are not. Art is something that attracts anyone and by putting an attractive thing in something, it can increase their curiousity and their interest. Most of us would love to code to make a cool image or video game not black sheet full of just code. So art can make CS fun espically those who are artists or love art. 

Fortunately, I am one of those people love art and is a visual learner. So having art in my coding languages can make me more focus and increase my interest. That is why I never liked C++, it was limited in the art you could do and most of time, it was just a giant black screen of code and letters. That is also why I loved Adobe as you can code easily and make a video game or art via coding. Overall, I believe with more art there would be more people would interested in computer science and art would shatter the stereotypes of coding like staring at a black screen and typing for hours and art would also more learning easier for visual learner like me.
